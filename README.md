Example project using CMake as build system. Included executable linking with shared library with some other configurable features of CMake.

CMake itself but with modified and improvements.

# Usage

* Create a build directory i.e. `build` or any desired name
* `cd` into such directory, then `cmake ..`
* Now you can inspect `CMakeLists.txt`, `MathFunctions/CMakeLists.txt` and its effect towards the result of the build operation
